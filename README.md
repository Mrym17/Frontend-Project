# Getting Started with Create React App

This project is made using reactjs, html, css and javascript using IDE Visual Studio code. (Tailwind CSS was not used as I was not very confident with it so couldn't risk experimenting :( so, i'd have to learn working with it first in order to implement it.)


                                    -------------------------------------------


The project can be dowloaded or cloned from the github repository. 

In case of downloading, project should be opened through vs code. On openening the project folder in vs code, The command 'npm install' must be used to install npm(node modules) for this project. Upon installing, the command 'npm start' must be written (Runs the app in the development mode - Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser) to the terminal to launch the project on your local host.

Or the project can be directly cloned from the github.
